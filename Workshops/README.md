| **Workshop Leader**: Dr. Phillip Richmond <br> <br> **Profile:** Dr. Richmond is a staff scientist in the Precision Health Initiative at BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute. He completed his PhD in Bioinformatics at UBC, focusing on ways to expand the utility of whole genome sequencing in the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases. In his current role, he teaches researchers and clinicians how to harness the power of precision health technologies to understand child health and disease, and also applies these technologies to help find answers for children and families on the diagnostic odyssey at BC Children’s Hospital. <br> **Fun Fact:** Phil loves dogs, and his dog Sherlock (who you’ll see in the slides) was once a model for a TV commercial when he was a puppy. Hopefully Sherlock’s acting career can be reignited following the pandemic. | ![PhillipRichmondHeadshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59856969/176570133-4c72dda6-83ed-4ae9-9e87-b63113ccb19a.jpg) |

Dr. Singh laboratory is a computational biology lab focused on biomarker discovery and developing methods and tools for multiomics data integration and visualization. Dr. Singh’s research focuses on the identification of biomarkers for heart and lung disease such as asthma and heart failure using high throughput biological (“omics”) datasets. Dr. Singh developed DIABLO, an integrative multiomics classification method as part of the mixOmics data integration project ([mixomics.org](http://mixomics.org)). Through active collaborations with clinicians and wet-bench scientists, Dr. Singh’s research incorporates patient cohorts with model systems with single cell and spatial technologies dissecting molecular mechanisms of disease. <br> **Fun Fact:** In his free time Amrit is either training his 1.5 year old Australian Cattle Dog mix or hanging out with his newborn. | ![amritsingh_pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59856969/174682224-44e002ba-9700-4d7a-bc18-dbd63d77bc88.jpg) |

He has a Bachelor of Science conferred jointly by UBC and BCIT with a major in biotechnology and a minor in computer science. He has previously worked at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre as a computational biologist and has experience working with a variety of single-cell methods including DNA methylation and accessibility. <br> **Fun Fact:** Picked up chess online in 2019 during the pandemic, and has been playing ever since! |  |  
| **Workshop Leaders**: Will Casazza and Amy Inkster <br> <br> **Will's Profile:** Will is a PhD Candidate in Bioinformatics at BCCHRI, supervised by Dr. Jessica Dennis and Dr. Sara Mostafavi. He studies the association between genetic variation and DNA methylation, and all manner of ways that we can use this information to better understand heritable diseases. His main project consists of mapping this type of association in both male and female placental samples in order to gain insight into several childhood onset diseases. <br> **Fun Fact:** Will spent the pandemic self-teaching jazz and classical piano since his last formal lesson 15 years ago! <br> <br> **Amy's Profile:** Amy is a doctoral student in Medical Genetics in Dr. Wendy Robinson’s lab at the BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute. She studies DNA methylation and other genomic features associated with fetal health in pregnancy, her main projects aim to understand the differences in health outcomes between pregnancies carrying male and female fetuses. <br> **Fun Fact:** Amy was in a lot of spelling bees as a kid, and in a national spelling bee in elementary school, she lost on the word “prerogative” (the silent R got me!!) | ![Will](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59856969/176570248-3f1d1efa-83ac-42c6-843e-b63f69aaf185.png) <br> ![Amy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59856969/176570195-c0a53d8b-8a14-4b1c-9435-4fb01f32dfdd.JPG) |  
| **Workshop Leader**: Nikita Telkar  <br> <br> **Profile:** Nikita is a current PhD Candidate in the Medical Genetics program at UBC. She earned her BSc in Biomedical Genetics from Newcastle University, and her MSc in Genetics of Human Disease from University College London (UCL). Having only undertaken wet-lab projects in her undergrad, she chose her Masters project to be in statistical genetics, and thus self-taught herself R Programming, and has been using it since. She is involved in several active collaborations through which she enthusiastically learns the analysis techniques of different genomic data types, and has a vested interest in how ancestry contributes towards genetic variation. <br> **Fun Fact:** Nikita loves to cook, and tries to make a new recipe every week. Her successful attempts (and now favorites) include coq au vin blanc, Chinese egg drop soup, and mini lemon-white chocolate cheesecakes, to name a few. | ![NT_Profile_Apr2022](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59856969/174682972-dc16c2d4-061c-493a-89f1-ae5e33e2cc7e.jpg)|
