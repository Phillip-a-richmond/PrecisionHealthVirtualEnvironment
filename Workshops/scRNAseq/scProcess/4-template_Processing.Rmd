This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
library(Seurat)
library(sctransform)
library(ggplot2)
```

prep for integration
```{r}
name <- "/PBMCs_C"
objects <- paste0("~/scProcess",name,"/objects")
PBMCs_C <- readRDS(paste0(objects,"/PBMCs_C_DF_so.rds"))
#PBMCs_C <- readRDS("~/scProcess/PBMCs_C/objects/PBMCs_C_DF_so.rds")
PBMCs_C

name <- "/PBMCs_X"
objects <- paste0("~/scProcess",name,"/objects")
PBMCs_X <- readRDS(paste0(objects,"/PBMCs_X_DF_so.rds"))
#PBMCs_X <- readRDS("~/Student_Stuff/scProcess/PBMCs_X/objects/PBMCs_X_DF_so.rds")
PBMCs_X

dir.create("~/scProcess/integrated")
int_path <- "~/scProcess/integrated"
obj_int_name <- "/PBMCs_int"
```

prep for integration, swap in to merge the objects you want to integrate
```{r}
objects.combined <- merge(PBMCs_C, y = PBMCs_X, add.cell.ids = c("PBMCs_C", "PBMCs_X"), project = "PBMC_Machines")
```


```{r}
int_list <- SplitObject(objects.combined, split.by = "orig.ident")
int_list <- lapply(X = int_list, FUN = SCTransform) #runs SCTransform on each object in the list

features <- SelectIntegrationFeatures(object.list = int_list, nfeatures = 3000)
int_list <- PrepSCTIntegration(object.list = int_list, anchor.features = features)

# integrate
int.anchors <- FindIntegrationAnchors(object.list = int_list, normalization.method = "SCT", anchor.features = features)
obj_int <- IntegrateData(anchorset = int.anchors, normalization.method = "SCT")

# specify that we will perform downstream analysis on the corrected data note that the
# original unmodified data still resides in the 'RNA' assay
DefaultAssay(obj_int) <- "integrated"

# Run the standard workflow for visualization and clustering
obj_int <- ScaleData(obj_int, verbose = FALSE)
obj_int <- RunPCA(obj_int, npcs = 30, verbose = FALSE)
obj_int <- RunUMAP(obj_int, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:30)
obj_int <- FindNeighbors(obj_int, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:30)
obj_int <- FindClusters(obj_int, resolution = 0.4, graph.name = "integrated_nn") 
# You will have to adjust this cluster resolution based on your data and what make biological sense, you may need to do this a few times to get the proper number of clusters. My mentality is it's better to over-cluster than under-cluster as you can always group clusters together that you think are the same cell type. 

#obj_int <- ReclusterCells(obj_int, resolution = 0.15, graph.name = "integrated_nn")
# use this function to recluster a cluster into smaller clusters (so many clusters...)

UMAPPlot(obj_int)
ggsave(plot=last_plot(), file = paste0(int_path,obj_int_name,"_origID_UMAP.pdf"), height = 8, width = 10)

UMAPPlot(obj_int, split.by = "orig.ident")
ggsave(plot=last_plot(), file = paste0(int_path,obj_int_name,"_split_origID_UMAP.pdf"), height = 8, width = 30)

saveRDS(obj_int, file = paste0(int_path,obj_int_name,".rds"))
```

Pull up the UMAP plot of the clusters
```{r}
UMAPPlot(obj_int)
```

Easy access to change assay types. For differential gene expression down the line, use SCT or RNA assays, never use integrated
```{r}
DefaultAssay(obj_int) <- "RNA"
DefaultAssay(obj_int) <- "SCT"
DefaultAssay(obj_int) <- "integrated"
```

Find cluster markers
```{r}
# find markers for every cluster compared to all remaining cells, report only the positive
# ones
cluster.markers <- FindAllMarkers(obj_int, only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25)
cluster.markers %>%
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    slice_max(n = 2, order_by = avg_log2FC)
write.csv(cluster.markers, file = paste0(int_path,obj_int_name,"_cluster_markers.csv"))
```

Get information on cluster markers and show it as a heatmap
```{r}
cluster.markers %>%
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    top_n(n = 10, wt = avg_log2FC) -> top10
DoHeatmap(obj_int, features = top10$gene) + NoLegend()
ggsave(plot=last_plot(), file = paste0(int_path,obj_int_name,"_cluster_marker_heatmap.pdf"), height = 20, width = 30)
```

Label cell types
```{r}
levels(obj_int)
cell_type <- c("Naive T", "Classical monocyte", "Intermediate monocyte", "CD8+ T", "B", "Non-classical monocytes", "gdT-cell", "NK", "DC")
names(cell_type) <- levels(obj_int)
obj_int <- RenameIdents(obj_int, cell_type)
DimPlot(obj_int, reduction = "umap", label = TRUE, pt.size = 0.5) + NoLegend()
ggsave(plot=last_plot(), file = paste0(int_path,obj_int_name,"_celltype_UMAP.pdf"), height = 20, width = 30)
```
