This directory is for section 1 of part 1 of the workshop regarding cleaning 1000 Genomes individual-level data.

Unfortunately, the 1000 Genome and QC'd plink files (.bed/.bim/.fam) are too big to upload to Github. Please copy them into your student scratch space directory using:

`cp -R /scratch/tr-precisionhealth-1/Workshops/SNP_associations/1000G* /<your_directory_path>`

`cp -R /scratch/tr-precisionhealth-1/Workshops/SNP_associations/QCed* /<your_directory_path>`
