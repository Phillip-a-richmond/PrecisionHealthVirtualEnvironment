This is for the first of three applications in part 2 of the workshop: identifying the number of allele copies of individuals for use in a dataframe.

In `/scratch/tr-precisionhealth-1/Workshops/SNP_associations/allle_copies`, the `QCed_1000G` bed/bim/fam files are subsetted into plink files that contain only a single SNP across all individuals, `allele_copies_1kg`.
