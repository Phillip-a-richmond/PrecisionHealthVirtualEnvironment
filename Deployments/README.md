# Deployments
> This directory contains relevant information specific to each deployment of the PrecisionHealthVirtualEnvironment. 


## Systems
- [Sockeye](###Sockeye)



### Sockeye
Deployed on the UBC Advanced Research Computing high performance computing cluster called Sockeye (sockeye.arc.ubc.ca).

#### Project Space
> The project space stores databases, software, and training content. This is where the github repo lives.
Path to project space (this repo):
```
/project/st-sturvey-1/PrecisionHealthVirtualEnvironment/
```
#### Scratch Space
> The scratch space has a sandbox directory for playing around, and a workshop directory where group workshops are held.
NOTE: The scratch space will be auto-purged, so content meant to last should be migrated away to individual user folders on Sockeye, and content for training/databases/workflows should be added to the project space.
Path to scratch space:
