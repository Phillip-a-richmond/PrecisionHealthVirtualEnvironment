# Rstudio Problem Set

1. Set up a directory to Run Rstudio in. You may have already accomplished this if you followed along today in class.

2. Deploy Rstudio, and install the package "Seurat".

3. Launch Rstudio, and load the Seurat Library.

4. Take a snapshot.

5. Shut down your Rstudio job.

6. Success! You're done! If you want to continue play around in Rstudio, I encourage you to get more comfortable.
