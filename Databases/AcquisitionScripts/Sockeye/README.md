# Acquisition Scripts for Sockeye
> This is how I get the databases into their places.


There are 4 primary scripts here:
- FetchDBs\_GRCh37.sh
- FetchDBs\_GRCh38.sh
- FetchGenericDBs.sh
- PrepareRefGenomes.sh

Each script downloads several databases into locations in the PrecisionHealthVirtualEnvironment. 

*NOTE*: Use the FetchDBs\_GRCh3\*.sh files carefully, they download a LOT of data
